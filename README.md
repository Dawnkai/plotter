Project used for Embedded Systems project in Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.
The goals of this project are:
* Extracting contours from images
* Drawing them on A5 paper
* Saving them in a database for later reusage

The project currently supports uploading images from computer or taking pictures with PiCamera.

## Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1
* Raspbery Pi Camera Rev 1.3

## Repository structure
This repository contains the following files:
1. `static/css/styles.css` - global stylesheet with styles used in the whole webapp
2. `static/images` - this is where the app stores temporary images, **do not remove it**
3. `static/scripts/utls.js` - AJAX and vanilla JS functions used by the webapp
4. `templates/*.html` - pages of the webapp
5. `camera.py` - script controlling the camera
6. `database.py` - script for operating on the database
7. `extractor.py` - script for extracting contours from images using OpenCV library
8. `logger.py` - setup for logging:
* Logs of level `DEBUG` will be saved to a file named `plotter.log`
* Logs of level `INFO` will be printed to the console
9. `main.py` - main server with all the endpoints, merging all parts together
10. `plot.py` - script for working with the plotter
11. `requirements.pip` - list of libraries required in the project

## Installation
1. Install python on your Raspberry Pi (Python 3+):
```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
cd Python-3.6.0
./configure --enable-optimizations --prefix=/usr
make
```
2. Install pip:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
3. Install requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.pip
```
4. Start the server:
```
python3 server.py
```
5. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` in your browser and you are good to go!

## TODO
List of known bugs / possible improvements:
1. AJAX script is a mess, copy-pasted functions all over the place (due to lack of time), repeated calls can be made into functions
2. When removing (5\*n+1)-th image will not reset the pagination
