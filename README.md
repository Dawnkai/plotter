Project used for Embedded Systems project in Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.
The goals of this project are:
* Extracting contours from images
* Drawing them on A5 paper
* Saving them in a database for later reusage

The project currently supports uploading images from computer or taking pictures with PiCamera.

## Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1
* Raspbery Pi Camera Rev 1.3

## Repository structure
This repository contains the following files:
1. `static/css/styles.css` - global stylesheet with styles used in the whole webapp
2. `static/images` - this is where the app stores temporary images, **do not remove it**
3. `static/scripts/utls.js` - AJAX and vanilla JS functions used by the webapp
4. `static/scripts/camera.js` - script for interacting with camera API
5. `static/scripts/images.js` - script for fetching images from the database
6. `static/scripts/navigation.js` - script for navigating between pages
7. `static/scripts/plot.js` - script for interacting with the plotter
8. `static/scripts/stats.js` - script for fetching stats (plotter state, logs)
9. `static/scripts/upload.js` - script for uploading images to server
10. `templates/*.html` - pages of the webapp
11. `camera.py` - script controlling the camera
12. `database.py` - script for operating on the database
13. `entrypoint.sh` - bash script used to start the app
14. `extractor.py` - script for extracting contours from images using OpenCV library
15. `logger.py` - setup for logging:
* Logs of level `DEBUG` will be saved to a file named `plotter.log`
* Logs of level `INFO` will be printed to the console
16. `main.py` - main server with all the endpoints, merging all parts together
17. `plot.py` - script for working with the plotter
18. `requirements.pip` - list of libraries required in the project

## Installation
1. Install python on your Raspberry Pi (Python 3+):
```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
cd Python-3.6.0
./configure --enable-optimizations --prefix=/usr
make
```
2. Install pip:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
3. Install requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.pip
```
4. Ensure that the plotter is in starting position (0 on X and 0 on Y axis, plotter will move from and return there)!
5. Start the server:
```
sudo chmod 777 entrypoint.sh
./entrypoint.sh
```
6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` in your browser and you are good to go!
